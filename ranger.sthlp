Each of the {cmd: newvariable}s will be created in Stata as variables. Variable names must be valid in R and Stata. These functions can refer to the estimated {cmd: ranger} object as {cmd: RF}, and the {cmd: data.frame} containing the data used in the {cmd: ranger} command as {cmd: rangerdata}. Use "@@" instead of "$" where necessary. {p_end}
{synopt:{opt varsend(varlist)}} A list of variables to be sent to R alongside {help depvar} and {help varlist}, where they will be turned into vectors, for whatever purposes you have. Perhaps in one of your {cmd: varreturn} commands.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt precedes}} list of R commands, separated by semicolons ({cmd: ;}), of whatever you'd like R to do just before running {cmd: ranger::ranger}. These functions can refer to (and perhaps manipulate!) the analysis data as {cmd: rangerdata}, or refer to {cmd: varsend} vectors by name. Use "@@" instead of "$" where necessary.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt follows}} list of R commands, separated by semicolons ({cmd: ;}), of whatever you'd like R to do just after running {cmd: ranger::ranger} but before generating any of the variables to return. These functions can refer to the {cmd: ranger} object as {cmd: RF}. These functions can refer to the analysis data as {cmd: rangerdata}, or refer to {cmd: varsend} vectors by name.

{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ranger} is an interface between Stata and the function {cmd: ranger} in the R package {cmd: ranger}, by Wright & Ziegler (2017). It will send data to an R session, run the random forest, and then return the relevant results in variable or macro form. The relevant objects will remain in the R session and can be accessed and manipulated further with R code using {help rcall} afterwards (Haghish 2019). Run {help MLRtimesetup} before use for the first time. It is also strongly recommended that you read {cmd: rcall: help(ranger, package = 'ranger')} to understand the options syntax and how to use the {cmd: RF} object after it is created.

{pstd} 
One weakness of this command is that it does not automate working with training/holdout sets. Stata just isn't really made for that. However, this is not too difficult to do. Before running {cmd: ranger}, load your holdout data. Limit the dataset to just the prediction variables, and just the nonmissing observations. Send this to R as with {cmd: rcall: X.hold <- st.data()}. Then, load your training data and run {cmd: ranger} as normal, and add {cmd: predopts(data = X.hold)}. 

{pstd}
Syntax takes the form of {help depvar} {help varlist}. {help depvar} is the dependent variable being predicted. {help varlist} is the list of variables used to predict the dependent variable. These should all be variables loaded normally in Stata.

Note that this syntax example produces some strange {cmd: effectSE} results, but this is an artifact of the not-well-thought-out analysis; generally they won't all be identical.
