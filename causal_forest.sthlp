Use "@@" instead of "$" where necessary. For example, to get the average treatment effect and its standard errors, it would be {cmd: return(ate = average_treatment_effect(CF)[1]; ateSE = average_treatment_effect(CF)[2])} and then in Stata {cmd: display r(ate)} and {cmd: display r(ateSE)}.

{synopt:{opt precedes}} list of R commands, separated by semicolons ({cmd: ;}), of whatever you'd like R to do just before running {cmd: grf::causal_forest}.

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:causal_forest} is an interface between Stata and the function {cmd: causal_forest} in the R package {cmd: grf}, by Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager (2019). It will send data to an R session, run the causal forest, and then return the relevant results in variable or macro form. The relevant objects will remain in the R session and can be accessed and manipulated further with R code using {help rcall} afterwards (Haghish 2019). Run {help MLRtimesetup} before use for the first time. It is also strongly recommended that you read {cmd: rcall: help(causal_forest, package = 'grf')} to understand the options syntax and how to use the {cmd: CF} object after it is created.

{pstd} 
One weakness of this command is that it does not automate working with training/holdout sets. Stata just isn't really made for that. However, this is not too difficult to do. Before running {cmd: causal_forest}, load your holdout data. Limit the dataset to just the covariates in {cmd: X}, and just the nonmissing observations. Send this to R as a matrix with {cmd: rcall: X.hold <- as.matrix(st.data())}. Then, load your training data and run {cmd: causal_forest} as normal, but instead of using {cmd: pred()} to create predictions, instead use {cmd: varreturn()} and do {cmd: pred <- as.matrix(predict(CF, X.hold)@@predictions)}. See {browse "https://lost-stats.github.io/Machine_Learning/causal_forest.html":LOST} for a demonstration.

{pstd}
Syntax takes the form of {help depvar} {help indvar} {help varlist}. {help depvar} is the dependent variable being predicted ({cmd: Y} in {cmd: grf::causal_forest} syntax). {help indvar} is the treatment variable you are interested in seeing treatment effect heterogeneity for ({cmd: W}), and {help varlist} is the list of variables used to predict treatment effect heterogeneity. These should be variables in Stata and not matrices; {cmd: causal_forest} will convert them to matrices for {cmd: grf::causal_forest} use.

Note that this syntax example produces some strange {cmd: effectSE} results, but this is an artifact of the not-well-thought-out analysis; generally they won't all be identical.
